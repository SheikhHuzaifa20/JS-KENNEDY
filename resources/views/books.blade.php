                    <h5>He can see the future, but can he save it?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Curtis has a rare gift: he can see glimpses of the past, present, and future.
                    </p>
                    <p>But his visions come with a price: he can’t share them without changing the outcome.</p>
                    <p>
                        It didn’t matter, until he meets Christine—a fierce mercenary who sparks his interest and is
                        fated to be the heart of the guild he’s trying to build.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But their budding romance is interrupted when a vision reveals a threat to the child of a
                        friend. Now Curtis must gather a group of loyal and skilled fighters who can help him battle the
                        corruption growing in GreenRiver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Time is running out, and the enemy is not only powerful, but also cunning. Curtis and his
                        Hunters must face the ultimate challenge: to save a child, a city, and to protect a future that
                        only he can see.

                    <p>
                        The Dragon Protector asking Mackenzie for a favor—Maybe the sky truly has fallen…
                    </p>
                    <p>Mackenzie works for Catch and Release, a bounty-hunting guild, and she loves her job.</p>
                    <p>
                        She goes after the usual suspects: Rogue vampires, feral shifters, and crazed mages. Nightmare
                        stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last thing she ever imagined was Lucan, an infuriating and high-ranking dragon shifter,
                        hiring her to find a child kidnapped from his Tribe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though her magical talents lean more towards bodyguarding and hunting dangerous beings,
                        condemning a kid to death isn’t who she is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But as Mackenzie gets deeper into her hunt, she uncovers deadly secrets surrounding the child,
                        the kidnapper, and Lucan himself…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing’s for sure; when the going gets tough, Mackenzie gets dangerous!

                    <h5>You’re only paranoid if nobody’s out to get you.</h5>
                    <p>
                        Mackenzie’s paranoia hasn’t ebbed, if anything, it’s only gotten worse, and it’s starting to
                        wear thin on her family. Add in a new familiar, and her sister’s sudden rebellion, and tempers
                        ignite.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a hunter for Catch and Release, Mackenzie doesn’t choose her assignments, they are chosen for
                        her. So, when Lucan has doubts about the security for the upcoming peace summit, he hires
                        Mackenzie to be his deadly arm candy.</p>
                    <p>
                        But being on Lucan’s arm has an unexpected effect.

                    <p>
                        He’s the Dragon Protector, and she should know better than to get attached, but despite her best
                        effort, her feelings for him spark into something more.

                    <p>
                        As the summit drags on and things heat up Mackenzie receives a terrifying message and she’s
                        forced to choose: freedom or the life of someone she’s bound to protect. However, Mackenzie’s
                        choices have deeper consequences, as secrets she has carefully guarded are about to be revealed…

                    <h5>Two paths, one fate.</h5>
                    <p>
                        Lucan now knows who—and what— Mackenzie truly is. She is Terra, the supernatural boogieman whose
                        tales of carnage are used by parents to bring wayward children in line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But she’s captive, and the longer it takes to free her, the less choice he has – break the bond,
                        or die.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mackenzie—thrust back into the nightmare of her childhood—learns the awful truth. Her captors
                        have no mercy… and now they know how to force her to do their bidding. Her achilleas heel. And
                        they’ll use that knowledge against her in the worst possible way. But as her hopes for rescue
                        dwindle, she must use every bit of her wits and skills just to survive. Because even in
                        darkness, light can be found.​
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mackenzie must hold out long enough for those she loves to free her, but every passing second
                        brings her closer to crumbling under the weight of a past she can’t outrun.

                        Book 3 of the Mackenzie Green series features twists and turns that will keep you reading until
                        the final page.

                        After being held captive and tortured for months, Mackenzie is finally home. But her peace is
                        shattered when Master Dagmar asks for her help. Children are still going missing, and the Task
                        Force created to stop these abductions is hitting road bumps at every turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>With her powerful mate by her side, she must track down the Rogue, a monster vampire crazed from

                    <p>
                        Their hunt leads them to the Warrens, the vampire city below GreenRiver. Where they delve deep
                        into the world of the undead. Together, Lucan and Mackenzie must stop the Rogue before more
                        young lives are lost.

                        With their relationship still forming, can Lucan and Mackenzie strengthen their bond enough to
                        finally overcome their foe? Or will the trauma of the past be the catalyst that tears them
                        apart?

                    <h2>Green Dragon - <span class="d-block"> Mackenzie Green</span>Book 5 - Coming Soon!</h2>
                    <h5>Their world teeters on the brink of war; the time to act is now.</h5>
                    <p>
                        Mackenzie and Lucan should be celebrating their newly awakened bond. Instead, they’re working to
                        stop Jasper, the tyrannical Dragon Head, from moving forward with the next step of his sinister
                        plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If he succeeds, GreenRiver’s Mythos shifters won’t be the only ones who suffer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But challenging Jasper for his throne means preparing for danger. Chaos ensues as a rogue guild
                        accepts a bounty on Lucan’s head, and Mackenzie will stop at nothing to keep her mate from the
                        same fate as his father.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all, Lucan’s heart and soul belong to Mackenzie, and anyone who dares to harm him will
                        have to face her wrath.
